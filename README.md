fisl is scheme lox

A port of Lox from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)
to Chicken Scheme, mostly for the learnings.

Pronounced like "fizzle".

Currently a WIP. I'm actively reading the book with a book club (as of 2022-10)
and following along here when I have time. I'm also learning Scheme as I go, so
it may be a bit non-idiomatic in places!
